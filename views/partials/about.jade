          | Hey there. My name is Duo Tao and I'm a {{classyear | lowercase}} at Carleton College. I study Computer Science and Physics. I do Web Development, and I develop Mac software too. Academically, I am very interested in theoretical computer science like algorithms, databases or basically "how this works". I believe there must be smart ideas behind every awesome technologies, and I want to discover them! Same with physics, it tells me "how things works" in the real world, and there are even more ingenious ideas because of its long history.
